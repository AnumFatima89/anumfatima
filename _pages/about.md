I am a student working towards my [DPhil in Statistics](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/people/anum-fatima) at the University of Oxford, and a [lecturer](https://www.lcwu.edu.pk/anum-fatima.html) in statistics at Lahore College for Women University, Lahore (currently on study leave). My DPhil is graciously funded by the Commonwealth Scholarship Commission in the United Kingdom. 

I am mostly interested in working on Stein's method, network models, and probability distributions. Currently, I am working on Stein's method for Stochastic blockmodels under the supervision of [Professor Gesine Reinert](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/people/gesine-reinert). I am also interested in learning about hypergraphs.

Previously, I developed a univariate probability distribution, namely the Generalized Poisson-Exponential distribution during my MS in Statistics and two other distributions, the Extended Poisson Exponential distribution and the Transmuted exponentiated Pareto-I distribution after completing my MS. I derived some distributional properties of Generalized order statistics for Extended-Exponential distribution in my research during my BS in Statistics at Lahore College for Women University.
