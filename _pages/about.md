Currently, I am working towards my [DPhil in Statistics](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/people/anum-fatima) at the University of Oxford with gracious funding from the Commonwealth Scholarship Commission, United Kingdom. Otherwise, I am a [lecturer](https://www.lcwu.edu.pk/anum-fatima.html) in statistics at Lahore College for Women University, Lahore (currently on study leave). My research interests include Stein's method, network models, and probability distributions. Currently, I am working on Stein's method and network models under the supervision of [Professor Gesine Reinert](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/people/gesine-reinert). Before, that I worked on probability distributions. In my MS in Statistics at Lahore College for Women University, Lahore I worked on Generalized Poisson-Exponential distribution; in my BS in Statistics, I worked on Distributional properties of Generalized order statistics for Extended-Exponential distribution.
